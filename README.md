SAIT Web Development Lab Assignment 3

Part A:
Your goal is to reformat this text file (davidthompson.txt) to an html document that uses CSS. You have some ‘artistic license’ in how you proceed. The completed page will use CSS to achieve the following attributes:
Use a background image, colour or pattern of your choice.
Experiment using Google Fonts at: https://www.google.com/fonts
The content of the web page should cover 80% of the width and be centred on the page. Use the appropriate <div> and <p> tags to achieve this.
Create a unique style for the first letter of the first word in each paragraph. Change the font at least 50% larger and of a different colour than the rest of the paragraph text. (NOTE: This is NOT complicated!)
Find images of the following and incorporate them into your document:
A picture of David Thompson (add Canadian Explorer to your search)
A picture of a map drawn by David Thompson.
Three pictures from the area known as  David Thompson Country.
Use CSS to evenly control the size of the pictures displayed to a maximum of 200 pixel width. Use the <figure> tag to provide a source of the image and the <figcaption> tag to include a description of each picture. The pictures will be displayed with content of the essay and the text can ‘wrap’ around the pictures.  
At the end of your document include a link to the ‘David Thompson Country’ website. Include ‘a:hover’ in your css file. The link must change colour when the mouse hover on the link.
 

Part B:
Note: You may need to run the following using the ‘Chrome’ internet browser.
Create a customized registration form for ‘Western Columbia Grocers’ that will ask a user the following information:
Name
Address
Telephone Number
Age
E-mail
Registration Date

Use the following HTML 5 input types to control the input:

Use a pattern so that ‘Name’ only accepts alphabetical characters and hyphens. Limit the ‘Name’ to 25 characters.
Use the ‘tel’ and ‘email’ input type. Use a ‘pattern’ to check for valid phone numbers and e-mail addresses
Use a ‘number’ input for age.
Use the ‘date’ input type for Registration Date.

Include a ‘reset’ and a ‘submit’ button. The ‘submit’ will e-mail this information to http://localhost/registration.html and use method=”GET”. 

The page will include a background image of your choosing. Change the ‘opacity’ of the image and make sure that whatever is present in the foreground has adequate contrast with the background image.

The page should be formatted that the input fields are evenly placed. You can use a ‘table’ or ‘div’ values. Add a ‘css’ page to control the background colour, text and position of the form
